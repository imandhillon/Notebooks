    "# Regex and re in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### The fundamentals of regex and an overview of the re module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a widely used toolset for accomplishing many tasks. At the core, their purpose is for finding patterns in character strings, or text, so that we can easily manipulate the text or do something with the information gained or patterns found. This page will go over the special characters used within regular expressions as well as the functions within the re module in Python and how they may be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions are a special sequence of characters that will match a particular pattern in another string of characters. It's a bit like a language in it of itself, with its own syntax and behavior. It's not turing complete of course, as you can't increment or decrement a string with it alone.\n",
    "A regular expression in Python will take the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    r'(pattern to match)'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw String Literals\n",
    "The 'r' is used to avoid ambiguity in interpretation of certain special characters, such as the backslash ('\\') or quotation marks (\"\"), which would be caused by the parsing of the string done by Python's parser, followed by Python's regular expression parser. R or r used as the prefix to the expression means 'raw string literal', which makes Python's first parser treat the sequence as a simple string, ignoring or passing over it, in a way. Namely, a few examples of where this is relevant would include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    r'\\n' == '\\\\n'\n",
    "Which matches a '\\' followed by a 'n', so a two character string instead of a one, as '\\n' (newline) is.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    r'[\"'](.*)[\"']' == '[\\\"\\'](.*)[\\\"\\']'\n",
    "    \n",
    "Likewise, this prevents the quotations from tripping the interpreter up, as the expression would get cut off at this part otherwise:\n",
    "\n",
    "    r'[\"'\n",
    "And the rest of it would cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the backslash could be used instead of the 'r' in order to escape these characters, but it is standard practice and easier to read if we just use 'r'.\n",

    "### Special Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a bunch of special charaters used by the engine to represent certain matching behaviors or patterns. Essentially the syntax of this 'language'. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```.``` - Period. This will match any single character, except newline.\n",
    "* ```\\w``` - Word character. This will match any single letter, digit, or underscore.\n",
    "* ```\\W``` - Complement set of word character. Matches anything \\w won't.\n",
    "* ```\\s``` - Whitespace character. Matches single newline, tab, space, carriage return (\\n, \\t, ' ', \\r).\n",
    "  * You can also choose to match a specific one with just \\n or \\t, or whatever you want.\n",
    "* ```\\S``` - Any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "* ```\\d``` - Any single number (digit).\n",
    "* ```\\D``` - Any non-number.\n",
    "* ```^``` - Caret. (Equal to \\A at start of string) Starts the match only at the start of a string. This can be made to work as a multiline operator with the parameter flags=re.MULTILINE, given in most re functions, which will look for the pattern after every \\n in the string\n",
    "* ```$``` - Dollar sign. Matches a pattern at the end of string. Can also work with multiline.\n",
    "* ```\\z``` - End of string.\n",
    "* ```\\Z``` - End of string or just before newline, if it exists."

    "\n",
    "#### Lookarounds\n",
